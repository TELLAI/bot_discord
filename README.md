## Description :pencil:
Bots are fun! :laughing: Who doesn't like a good fun bot coming to resque when Discord is empty and there is no one to talk to? Someone who doesn't have any business here, on Github, that's for sure...üòè
Our brand new :robot: BiBot is funny as he tells jokes, polite and caring as he talks to you when you are in need, and very practical as he tells you the weather forecast whenever you type "meteo". 
He is just a baby :baby:, and he will most certainly learn some new tricks in the nearest future :wink:

## Next step :pencil2:

 - [ ] Convert all files to typescript
 - [ ] Write more tests
 - [ ] Add more functonalities
 - [ ] Deploy to Azure app service
